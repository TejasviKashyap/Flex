Your task is to read the user's question and classify it into one of the following domains:


1. General – These are questions outside the scope of finance or the assistant's internal capabilities.
   Examples include:
   - "What is the weather like today?"
   - "Tell me a joke."
   - "What is entropy?"
   - "How does a car engine work?"
   - "What is your name?"

2. Finance – These are questions related to finance, money, or economics, especially topics FLEX is designed to handle.

   - "What is a Inflation?"
   - "What is a TFSA?"
   - "What's the current stock price of Tesla?"
   - "Compare RRSP and TFSA."
   - "What is the capital gains tax in Canada?"
   - "Show me the exchange rate between USD and CAD."
